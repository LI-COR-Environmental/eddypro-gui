# Welcome to EddyPro&reg;

EddyPro&reg; is a powerful open source software application for processing eddy
covariance data. It computes fluxes of water vapor (evapotranspiration), carbon
dioxide, methane, other trace gases, and energy with the Eddy Covariance method.

EddyPro is developed, maintained and
supported by [LI‑COR Biosciences](www.licor.com). It originates from
[ECO<sub>2</sub>S](http://gaia.agraria.unitus.it/eco2s),
the Eddy COvariance COmmunity Software project, which was developed as part
of the Infrastructure for Measurement of the European Carbon Cycle (IMECC-EU)
research project. We gratefully acknowledge the
[IMECC](http://imecc.ipsl.jussieu.fr/index.html) consortium,
the ECO<sub>2</sub>S development team, the [University of Tuscia](www.unitus.it) (Italy)
and scientists around the world who assisted with development and testing of
the original version of this software.

## Overview

The EddyPro installer installs the following components:

- EddyPro Engine, the core engine, a command line software
- EddyPro GUI, the graphical user interface to configure and run the engine
- EddyPro Help, consisting in a local context-sensitive help system, a local
    html version of the online EddyPro Help system, the 'Getting Started' and
    'User Guide' documents in PDF format

Both are pre-built for a particular environment (operating system and compiler).

##Source Code Repository

EddyPro is a fully cross-platform application, which consists of a set of
command line programs and a graphical user interface (GUI).

The source code is developed using two independent Git repositories, namely:

  - eddypro-engine
  - eddypro-gui

## Installing EddyPro

You can download EddyPro from the LI-COR
[EddyPro website](http://www.licor.com/eddypro).
The site provides download links for all supported platforms.

Start the installation program like any executable on the development platform.
Select the components that you want to install and follow the instructions of
the installation program to complete the installation.

## Building EddyPro from source

To build EddyPro follow these instructions:

### Engine

To compile the Engine use [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran)
(The GNU Fortran compiler) and run:

    $ make Makefile_rp
    $ make Makefile_fcc

### GUI

To compile the GUI:

1. install the [Qt framework](http://qt-project.org/)
2. install [git](http://git-scm.com/)
3. build the Qt `eddypro.pro` project file using custom build scripts available
   under `source/scripts/build` or using QtCreator

In both cases, the build configuration will be shadowed or out-of-tree, i.e. created in a dedicated
directory outside the source tree.

#### Build the GUI using provided scripts

##### On Windows

Launch git-bash and enter the following commands, where `eddypro-source-dir` is
the directory where the source code is:

    1. $ cd eddypro-source-dir/source/scripts/build/
    2. $ ./win-build-eddypro.sh [debug|release]

##### On Mac

In a terminal enter the following commands, where `eddypro-source-dir` is the
directory where the source code is:

    1. $ cd eddypro-source-dir/source/scripts/build/
    2. $ ./mac-build-eddypro.sh [debug|release]

#### Build the GUI using QtCreator (on Windows or Mac)

    1. Open 'source\eddypro.pro'
    2. Open 'source\libs\quazip\quazip\eddypro.pro'
    3. In the 'eddypro.pro' project settings:
        3.1 set the build directory to '..\build\build-eddypro-6.1.0-qt-5.4.2-mingw-4.9.1-x86_64'
            for both debug and release targets
        3.2 check all the listed libs as dependencies
    4. In the 'quazip.pro' project settings:
        4.1 set the build directory to '..\..\..\..\build\libs\build-quazip-0.7.1-qt-5.4.2-mingw-4.9.1-x86_64'
            for both debug and release targets
    5. In the 'eddypro.pro' project, build both targets

## Utilities

To successfully run Eddypro, the program installation folder must contain the
following command line utilities under the 'bin' sub-directory:

- 7-zip
- pausep

### 7-zip

[7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) is a file archiver.

The console application consists of two files:
- 7z.dll
- 7z.exe

### pausep

Pausep it's a Win32 process suspend/resume tool, available on
[Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2964/Win-process-suspend-resume-tool).

It consists of one file:
- pausep.exe
