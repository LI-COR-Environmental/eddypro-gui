                                                <p>Wind measurements by a sonic anemometer may be biased by systematic deviation, which needs to be eliminated (e.g., for a proper assessment of tilt angles). You may get these offsets from the calibration certificate of your units, but you could also assess it easily, by recording the 3 wind components from the anemometer enclosed in a box with still air (zero-wind test). Any systematic deviation from zero of a wind component is a good estimation of this bias.</p>
