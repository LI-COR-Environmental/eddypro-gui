The methods are named after the corresponding reference publication. The method by <a href="references.html#Moncrieff2">Moncrieff et al. (1997)</a> is referred to as purely analytic, for it makes use of mathematical formulations to model flux spectral properties and to describe flux attenuations due to the instrument setup. The method by <a href="references.html#horst1997">Horst (1997)</a> is analytic in nature, but it is parameterized using <i>in situ</i> information. The method by <a href="references.html#Ibrom">Ibrom et al. (2007)</a>, instead, is mostly based on <i>in situ</i> determinations.</p>
                                                <p>The three methods are briefly described below. Please refer to the original papers for more in depth information.</p>
                                                <h2 class="noTOC" id="SpectralcorrectionsafterMoncrieffetal1997" data-magellan-target="SpectralcorrectionsafterMoncrieffetal1997">Spectral corrections after <a href="references.html#Moncrieff2">Moncrieff et al. (1997)</a></h2>
                                                <p>In this method, true cospectra estimation (Step 1) is performed by using analytical cospectra formulations, again according to Eqs. 12-18 in Moncrieff et al. (1997). Step 2 is performed by specifying a low-pass transfer function (LPTF), which depends on the EC system characteristics. In the implemented method, the LPTF is specified by the superimposition of a set of transfer functions describing individual sources of high-frequency losses. Refer to Appendix A of Moncrieff et al. (1997) for the full description of the individual transfer functions. Such transfer functions depend on the instrument setup (through the instrumentsâ path lengths, acquisition frequencies, separations etc.) but also on atmospheric conditions (because some quantities are defined as a function of the average wind speed), thus they must be recalculated for each flux averaging period.</p>

The application of the method requires the calculation of the time constants associated to the first-order filters that describe the physical phenomenon, and whose analytical expression are detailed in Massman (2000, Table 1). The actual correction formulas are detailed in Massman (2001, Table 1), which refined Table 2 in the previous paper.</p>

The time response of the gas instruments is calculated on-the-fly by EddyPro as part of the method, so the modifier is applied only if appropriate.</p>
                                                <p>All parameters needed in the correction are available to or are calculated by EddyPro, so there is no need of userâs input to apply the method, with only one exception for closed-path gas analyzers: the âtube parameterâ (Î), that quantifies the attenuation of a gas in a tube flow and that is a function of the gas itself and of the tube Reynolds number. This parameter is calculated by EddyPro via a linear interpolation of the values provided in <a href="references.html#Massman1991">Massman (1991, Table 1)</a>, starting from the actual Reynolds number calculated for the current sampling line (i.e., starting from the provided tube geometry and flow rate). Table 1 in Massman (1991) details the value of Î for CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>3</sub>, so the correction can only be applied for those gases.</p>

                                                <p>The estimation of system filtering characteristics (Step 2) is based on the <i>in situ</i> determination of the system cut-off frequency, assuming that the Eddy Covariance system acts on the true gas spectra (<i>S</i>) as a low-pass filter, in such a way that measured spectra (<i>S<sub>m</sub></i>) are attenuated at the high frequency end. Mathematically, this effect is described with a first-order recursive, infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. The discrete Fourier transform (<i>H<sub>IIR</sub></i>) of the amplitude of such filter is well approximated by the Lorentzian:</p>

                                                <p>This spectral correction scheme only deals with flux attenuations induced by attenuation of the scalar spectra. Other sources of flux underestimation to be considered are intrinsic to the instrument deployment. Among them, relevant flux losses might come from the physical separation between the anemometer and the gas analyzer sampling volumes. While streamwise sensor displacement can be accounted for by compensating scalar time lags (assuming Taylorâs hypothesis of frozen turbulence), we suggest applying a further correction factor to account for any crosswind and/or vertical displacement, following the procedure proposed by <a href="references.html#horst1997">Horst and Lenschow</a> (2009, Eqs. 16â18 and 28â30): These are multiplicative factors, that are applied after fluxes have been partially corrected with the method proposed here.

                                                <p>Being designed to correct spectral losses in closed-path systems (specifically for water vapor), the methods of <a href="references.html#Ibrom">Ibrom et al. (2007)</a> and <a href="references.html#Fratini2012">Fratini et al. (2012)</a> do not natively account for losses due to spatial separation of the instruments (anemometer and gas analyzer), because this source of spectral losses is minor and can be safely neglected when compared to losses in the sampling lines. For open-path systems, however, spectral losses due to instrument separations are relatively more important (especially for systems placed low over smooth surfaces). <span class="product_namesEddyPro">EddyPro</span> allows you to account for these losses by applying the correction method proposed by <a href="references.html#horst2009">Horst and Lenschow (2009)</a>, when the methods of <a href="references.html#Ibrom">Ibrom et al. (2007)</a> and <a href="references.html#Fratini2012">Fratini et al. (2012)</a> are selected. <a href="references.html#horst2009">Horst and Lenschow (2009)</a> describe 3 correction terms to account for along-wind, crosswind and vertical separations. Note that losses for any along-wind separation are largely compensated by the procedure of time lag compensation, if this is applied.</p>
                                                <p>Thus, the method is available in two versions:</p>
                                                <ul class="bullet">
                                                    <li value="1">Along-wind, crosswind and vertical: suggested when the time lag compensation procedure is not applied.</li>
                                                    <li value="2">Only crosswind and vertical: suggested when the time lag compensation procedure is applied.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>The correction procedure is based on the following formulation for the dependency of the flux (<i>F(r)</i>) as a function of the distance between the instruments <i>(r)</i>, Eq. 13 in the original paper:</p>

                                                </p>
                                                <p>where <i>F</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">0</sub> is the unattenuated flux for r=0, and <i>k</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">m</sub><i>=2Ïn</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">m</sub><i>/z</i> is the wavenumber at the peak of the wavenumber-weighted cospectrum, <i>kCo(k), n</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">m</sub><i> = f</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">m</sub><i>z/U, f</i><sub style="font-style: italic;">m</sub> is the frequency at the peak of the cospectrum, and <i>U</i> is the wind speed.</p>
                                                <p>This formulation is then specified in the along-wind, crosswind, and vertical separations. Please refer to <a href="references.html#horst2009">Horst and Lenschow (2009)</a> for further details.</p>
                                                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When the methods of <a href="references.html#horst1997">Horst (1997)</a> or <a href="references.html#horst1997">Ibrom et al. (2007)</a> are selected for the low-pass filtering correction, the âband-passâ spectral correction is applied by first correcting for the high-pass filtering effects (multiplication of uncorrected fluxes by HPSCF) and then multiplying by LPSCF. Rigorously speaking, this procedure is not correct because according to the definition of the band pass correction factor, the multiplication with the LPTF and the HPTF are not commutative with the integral operator. However, the error introduced by this procedure is deemed negligible in most occasions.</p>
