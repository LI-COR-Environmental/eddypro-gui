define({'WPL Terms':{d:'Refers to the flux contributions arising because of air compressibility. Gas analyzers measure gas density (i.e., mole or mass of gas per volume of air). However, volume of air can change due to fluctuations of (primarily) air temperature, pressure and water vapor concentration. Such fluctuations must be taken into account when computing fluxes, either by converting gas measurements into dry mole fraction (if possible), or by adding compensation terms developed by Webb et al. (1980) for open-path setups and by Ibrom et al. (2007) for closed-path setups. Select the most appropriate method in EddyProâ€™s interface. If you select unsuitable WPL options, EddyPro will figure that out and automatically switch to the most appropriate WPL strategy, depending on the available measurements.',l:''},'Zero':{d:'A user calibration, which ensures that the instrument reads a concentration of zero when the actual concentration of a sample is zero.',l:''}});
